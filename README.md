Simulation, Transformation and Convergence of Random Variables

1: Simulation of random Variables:
File path: $Code_Directory/rp_project_1_1.m
Instructions: Run code as it is and it will generate the results for all 18 combinations after changing save path 
(3 distributions and 3 values of number of samples and 2 types of simulation methods).

2: Transformation of random variables:
File path: $Code_Directory/rp_project_1_2.m
Instructions: Run code as it is and it will generate the results for all 9 combinations after changing save path
(3 distributions and 3 values of number of samples).

3: Convergence of random variables:
Non-GUI File path: $Code_Directory/rp_project_1_3.m
GUI-based_app : 
Standalone app file: $Code_Directory/convergence_app.mlapp
app installation file: $Code_Directory/convergence_visualizer_app.mlappinstall

Instructions:
1. Select the desired distribution from the possible list of distributions in the drop down list
2. Provide a value for M -Number of realizations (Default value is 500)
3. Provide a value for N - Number of samples per realization (Default value is 2000)
4. Click the button Generate visualizations.
5. The figures will be populated in 2 to 4 seconds.
6. Can be repeated with different/same values of the inputs.
